# Unstoppable
 - Prevents pop-up layers from freezing your scroll bar and stops your browsing

Some sites usually show a pop-up and freeze your scroll bar to prevent you from continuing to read the content below the pop-up. This is especially annoying when you use adblockplus to remove the layers but your screen is frozen.

This extension changes the site style settings and automagically removes this lock.
